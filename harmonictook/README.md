Harmonic Took is a multiplayer city building game that might remind you of other multiplayer city building card games you might have played. But it's not that game! It's not really multiplayer, and it's not complete, and it doesn't include all of the fun stuff the game includes because -- let's be realistic -- I am probably not going to finish this project. 

# TODO: 
- Split off runTests() away from main() 
- Implement Purple(Card) class and its three members
- Implement payout multipliers for cheese and furniture factories
- Implement payout modifiers for the Shopping Mall (orange card) 
- Implement display of a player's current spread 
- Implement display of what a player might want to buy
- Implement a dice-roll step of the player's turn that uses the player's "improvements"
- Add ANSI-style colored text (orange, red, green, blue, purple) for rich display
- Build an integration test into main() that tests most behaviors
